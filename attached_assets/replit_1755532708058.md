# Discord Bot Project

## Overview

This is a comprehensive multi-purpose Discord bot built with Python using the discord.py library. The bot provides 150+ different commands across 9 categories through slash commands, including entertainment, gaming, moderation, utility, love calculator, server management, logging, private rooms, and extended features. It follows a modular architecture using Discord's cogs system to organize functionality into separate, manageable components.

## System Architecture

### Core Framework
- **Discord.py Library**: Uses the modern discord.py framework with slash commands (app_commands) and traditional prefix commands
- **Cogs System**: Modular architecture where features are organized into separate cog files for better maintainability
- **Event-Driven Design**: Bot responds to Discord events like `on_ready` and handles command errors gracefully

### Bot Structure
- **Main Bot File** (`main.py`): Central bot instance with event handlers and command error management
- **Configuration System** (`config.py`): Centralized configuration with colors, emojis, and content arrays (jokes, quotes, facts)
- **Cog-Based Modules**: Four main feature categories implemented as separate cogs
